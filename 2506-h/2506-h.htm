<h1>THE SLEEPING CAR&mdash;A FARCE<br />
by William D. Howells</h1>
<h2>I.</h2>
<p>SCENE: One side of a sleeping-car on the Boston and Albany Road.&nbsp;
The curtains are drawn before most of the berths; from the hooks and
rods hang hats, bonnets, bags, bandboxes, umbrellas, and other travelling
gear; on the floor are boots of both sexes, set out for THE PORTER to
black.&nbsp; THE PORTER is making up the beds in the upper and lower
berths adjoining the seats on which a young mother, slender and pretty,
with a baby asleep on the seat beside her, and a stout old lady, sit
confronting each other&mdash;MRS. AGNES ROBERTS and her aunt MARY.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Do you always take down your back hair, aunty?</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; No, never, child; at least not since I had such
a fright about it once, coming on from New York.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all
well enough to take down your back hair if it <i>is</i> yours; but if
it isn&rsquo;t, your head&rsquo;s the best place for it.&nbsp; Now,
as I buy mine of Madame Pierrot&mdash;</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you <i>wish</i> she wouldn&rsquo;t
advertise it as <i>human</i> hair?&nbsp; It sounds so pokerish&mdash;like
human flesh, you know.</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Why, she couldn&rsquo;t call it <i>in</i>human hair,
my dear.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (thoughtfully).&nbsp; No&mdash;just <i>hair</i>.</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Then people might think it was for mattresses.&nbsp;
But, as I was saying, I took it off that night, and tucked it safely
away, as I supposed, in my pocket, and I slept sweetly till about midnight,
when I happened to open my eyes, and saw something long and black crawl
off my bed and slip under the berth.&nbsp; <i>Such</i> a shriek as I
gave, my dear!&nbsp; &ldquo;A snake! a snake! oh, a snake!&rdquo; And
everybody began talking at once, and some of the gentlemen swearing,
and the porter came running with the poker to kill it; and all the while
it was that ridiculous switch of mine, that had worked out of my pocket.&nbsp;
And glad enough I was to grab it up before anybody saw it, and say I
must have been dreaming.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Why, aunty, how funny!&nbsp; How <i>could</i>
you suppose a serpent could get on board a sleeping-car, of all places
in the world!</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; That was the perfect absurdity of it.</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; Berths ready now, ladies.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (to THE PORTER, who walks away to the end of the car,
and sits down near the door).&nbsp; Oh, thank you.&nbsp; Aunty, do you
feel nervous the least bit?</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Nervous?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Well, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I suppose I&rsquo;ve
been worked up a little about meeting Willis, and wondering how he&rsquo;ll
look, and all.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t <i>know</i> each other, of course.&nbsp;
It doesn&rsquo;t stand to reason that if he&rsquo;s been out there for
twelve years, ever since I was a child, though we&rsquo;ve corresponded
regularly&mdash;at least <i>I</i> have&mdash;that he could recognize
me; not at the first glance, you know.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll have a full
beard; and then I&rsquo;ve got married, and here&rsquo;s the baby.&nbsp;
Oh, <i>no</i>! he&rsquo;ll never guess who it is in the world.&nbsp;
Photographs really amount to nothing in such a case.&nbsp; I wish we
were at home, and it was all over.&nbsp; I wish he had written some
particulars, instead of telegraphing from Ogden, &ldquo;Be with you
on the 7 A.M., Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Californians always telegraph, my dear; they never
think of writing.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t expensive enough, and it doesn&rsquo;t
make your blood run cold enough to get a letter, and so they send you
one of those miserable yellow despatches whenever they can&mdash;those
printed in a long string, if possible, so that you&rsquo;ll be <i>sure</i>
to die before you get to the end of it.&nbsp; I suppose your brother
has fallen into all those ways, and says &ldquo;reckon&rdquo; and &ldquo;ornary&rdquo;
and &ldquo;which the same,&rdquo; just like one of Mr. Bret Harte&rsquo;s
characters.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; But it isn&rsquo;t exactly our not knowing each
other, aunty, that&rsquo;s worrying me; that&rsquo;s something that
could be got over in time.&nbsp; What is simply driving me distracted
is Willis and Edward meeting there when I&rsquo;m away from home.&nbsp;
Oh, how <i>could</i> I be away! and why <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> Willis
have given us fair warning?&nbsp; I would have hurried from the ends
of the earth to meet him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe poor Edward ever
saw a Californian; and he&rsquo;s so quiet and preoccupied, I&rsquo;m
sure he&rsquo;d never get on with Willis.&nbsp; And if Willis is the
least loud, he wouldn&rsquo;t like Edward.&nbsp; Not that I suppose
he <i>is</i> loud; but I don&rsquo;t believe he knows anything about
literary men.&nbsp; But you can see, aunty, can&rsquo;t you, how very
anxious I must be?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see that I ought to have been
there when Willis and Edward met, so as to&mdash;to&mdash;well, to <i>break</i>
them to each other, don&rsquo;t you know?</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Oh, you needn&rsquo;t be troubled about that, Agnes.&nbsp;
I dare say they&rsquo;ve got on perfectly well together.&nbsp; Very
likely they&rsquo;re sitting down to the unwholesomest hot supper this
instant that the ingenuity of man could invent.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, do you <i>think</i> they are, aunty?&nbsp;
Oh, if I could <i>only</i> believe they were sitting down to a hot supper
together now, I should be <i>so</i> happy!&nbsp; They&rsquo;d be sure
to get on if they were.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing like eating to make
men friendly with each other.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know, at receptions,
how they never have anything to say to each other till the escalloped
oysters and the chicken salad appear; and then how sweet they are as
soon as they&rsquo;ve helped the ladies to ice?&nbsp; Oh, thank you,
<i>thank</i> you, aunty, for thinking of the hot supper.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
such a relief to my mind!&nbsp; You can understand, can&rsquo;t you,
aunty dear, how anxious I must have been to have my only brother and
my only&mdash;my husband&mdash;get on nicely together?&nbsp; My life
would be a wreck, simply a wreck, if they didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; And Willis
and I not having seen each other since I was a child makes it all the
worse.&nbsp; I do <i>hope</i> they&rsquo;re sitting down to a hot supper.</p>
<p>AN ANGRY VOICE from the next berth but one.&nbsp; I wish people in
sleeping-cars&mdash;</p>
<p>A VOICE from the berth beyond that.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re mistaken in
your premises, sir.&nbsp; This is a waking-car.&nbsp; Ladies, go on,
and oblige an eager listener.</p>
<p>[Sensation, and smothered laughter from the other berths.]</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (after a space of terrified silence, in a loud whisper
to her AUNT.)&nbsp; What horrid things!&nbsp; But now we really must
go to bed.&nbsp; It <i>was</i> too bad to keep talking.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
no idea my voice was getting so loud.&nbsp; Which berth will you have,
aunty?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d better take the upper one, because&mdash;</p>
<p>AUNT MARY (whispering).&nbsp; No, no; I must take that, so that you
can be with the baby below.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, how good you are, Aunt Mary!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
too bad; it is really.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t let you.</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Well, then, you must; that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; You
know how that child tosses and kicks about in the night.&nbsp; You never
can tell where his head&rsquo;s going to be in the morning, but you&rsquo;ll
probably find it at the foot of the bed.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t sleep
an instant, my dear, if I thought that boy was in the upper berth; for
I&rsquo;d be sure of his tumbling out over you.&nbsp; Here, let me lay
him down.&nbsp; [She lays the baby in the lower berth.]&nbsp; There!&nbsp;
Now get in, Agnes&mdash;do, and leave me to my struggle with the attraction
of gravitation.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, <i>poor</i> aunty, how will you ever manage
it?&nbsp; I <i>must</i> help you up.</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; No, my dear; don&rsquo;t be foolish.&nbsp; But you
may go and call the porter, if you like.&nbsp; I dare say he&rsquo;s
used to it.</p>
<p>[MRS. ROBERTS goes and speak timidly to THE PORTER, who fails at
first to understand, then smiles broadly, accepts a quarter with a duck
of his head, and comes forward to AUNT MARY&rsquo;S side.]</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Had he better give you his hand to rest your
foot in, while you spring up as if you were mounting horseback?</p>
<p>AUNT MARY (with disdain).&nbsp; <i>Spring</i>!&nbsp; My dear, I haven&rsquo;t
sprung for a quarter of a century.&nbsp; I shall require every fibre
in the man&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; His hand, indeed!&nbsp; You get in first,
Agnes.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; I will, aunty dear; but&mdash;</p>
<p>AUNT MARY (sternly).&nbsp; Agnes, do as I say.&nbsp; [MRS. ROBERTS
crouches down on the lower berth.]&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t choose that any
member of my family shall witness my contortions.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you look.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; No, no, aunty.</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Now, porter, are you strong?</p>
<p>PORTER.&nbsp; I used to be porter at a Saratoga hotel, and carried
up de ladies&rsquo; trunks dere.</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;ll do, I think.&nbsp; Now, then,
your knee; now your back.&nbsp; There!&nbsp; And very handsomely done.&nbsp;
Thanks.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Are you really in, Aunt Mary?</p>
<p>AUNT MARY (dryly).&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Good-night.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Good-night, aunty.&nbsp; [After a pause of some
minutes.]&nbsp; Aunty!</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Well, what?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Do you think it&rsquo;s perfectly safe?</p>
<p>[She rises in her berth, and looks up over the edge of the upper.]</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; I suppose so.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a well-managed road.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ve got the air-brake, I&rsquo;ve heard, and the Miller platform,
and all those horrid things.&nbsp; What makes you introduce such unpleasant
subjects?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean accidents.&nbsp; But,
you know, when you turn, it does creak so awfully.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t
mind myself; but the baby&mdash;</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Why, child, do you think I&rsquo;m going to break
through?&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m one of the <i>lightest</i>
sleepers in the world.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Yes, I know you&rsquo;re a light sleeper; but&mdash;but
it doesn&rsquo;t seem quite the same thing, somehow.</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; But it is; it&rsquo;s quite the same thing, and
you can be perfectly easy in your mind, my dear.&nbsp; I should be quite
as loth to break through as you would to have me.&nbsp; Good-night.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Yes; good-night, Aunty!</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Well?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; You ought to just see him, how he&rsquo;s lying.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a perfect log.&nbsp; <i>Couldn&rsquo;t</i> you just bend
over, and peep down at him a moment?</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Bend over!&nbsp; It would be the death of me.&nbsp;
Good-night.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Good-night.&nbsp; Did you put the glass into
my bag or yours?&nbsp; I feel so very thirsty, and I want to go and
get some water.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know why I should
be thirsty.&nbsp; Are you, Aunt Mary?&nbsp; Ah! here it is.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
disturb yourself, aunty; I&rsquo;ve found it.&nbsp; It was in my bag,
just where I&rsquo;d put it myself.&nbsp; But all this trouble about
Willis has made me so fidgety that I don&rsquo;t know where anything
is.&nbsp; And now I don&rsquo;t know how to manage about the baby while
I go after the water.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s sleeping soundly enough now;
but if he should happen to get into one of his rolling moods, he might
tumble out on to the floor.&nbsp; Never mind, aunty, I&rsquo;ve thought
of something.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll just barricade him with these bags and
shawls.&nbsp; Now, old fellow, roll as much as you like.&nbsp; If you
should happen to hear him stir, aunty, won&rsquo;t you&mdash;aunty!&nbsp;
Oh, dear! she&rsquo;s asleep already; and what shall I do?&nbsp; [While
MRS. ROBERTS continues talking, various notes of protest, profane and
otherwise, make themselves heard from different berths.]&nbsp; I know.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll make a bold dash for the water, and be back in an instant,
baby.&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t you move, you little rogue.&nbsp; [She
runs to the water-tank at the end of the car, and then back to her berth.]&nbsp;
Now, baby, here&rsquo;s mamma again.&nbsp; Are you all right, mamma&rsquo;s
own?</p>
<p>[A shaggy head and bearded face are thrust from the curtains of the
next berth.]</p>
<p>THE STRANGER.&nbsp; Look here, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want
to be disagreeable about this thing, and I hope you won&rsquo;t take
any offence; but the fact is, I&rsquo;m half dead for want of sleep,
and if you&rsquo;ll only keep quiet now a little while, I&rsquo;ll promise
not to speak above my breath if ever I find you on a sleeping-car after
you&rsquo;ve come straight through from San Francisco, day and night,
and not been able to get more than about a quarter of your usual allowance
of rest&mdash;I will indeed.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very sorry that I&rsquo;ve disturbed
you, and I&rsquo;ll try to be more quiet.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t suppose
I was speaking so loud; but the cars keep up such a rattling that you
never can tell how loud you <i>are</i> speaking.&nbsp; Did I understand
you to say that you were from California?</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; Yes, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; San Francisco?</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; Yes, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a terribly long journey,
isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; I know quite how to feel for you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
a brother myself coming on.&nbsp; In fact we expected him before this.&nbsp;
[She scans his face as sharply as the lamp-light will allow, and continues,
after a brief hesitation.]&nbsp; It&rsquo;s always such a silly question
to ask a person, and I suppose San Francisco is a large place, with
a great many people always coming and going, so that it would be only
one chance in a thousand if you did.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (patiently).&nbsp; Did what, ma&rsquo;am?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, I was just wondering if it was possible&mdash;but
of course it isn&rsquo;t, and it&rsquo;s very flat to ask&mdash;that
you&rsquo;d ever happened to meet my brother there.&nbsp; His name is
Willis Campbell.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (with more interest).&nbsp; Campbell?&nbsp; Campbell?&nbsp;
Yes, I know a man of that name.&nbsp; But I disremember his first name.&nbsp;
Little low fellow&mdash;pretty chunky?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Do you mean short and
stout?</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; Yes, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
a great many years since he went out there, and I&rsquo;ve never seen
him in all that time.&nbsp; I thought if you <i>did</i> happen to know
him&mdash;He&rsquo;s a lawyer.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite likely I know him; and in
the morning, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, excuse me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very sorry to
have kept you so long awake with my silly questions.</p>
<p>THE MAN IN THE UPPER BERTH.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t apologize, madam.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not a Californian myself, but I&rsquo;m an orphan, and away
from home, and I thank you, on behalf of all our fellow-passengers,
for the mental refreshment that your conversation has afforded us.&nbsp;
<i>I</i> could lie here and listen to it all night; but there are invalids
in some of these berths, and perhaps on their account it will be as
well to defer everything till the morning, as our friend suggests.&nbsp;
Allow me to wish you pleasant dreams, madam.</p>
<p>[THE CALIFORNIAN, while MRS. ROBERTS shrinks back under the curtain
of her berth in dismay, and stammers some inaudible excuse, slowly emerges
full length from his berth.]</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you mind me, ma&rsquo;am; I&rsquo;ve
got everything but my boots and coat on.&nbsp; Now, then [standing beside
the berth, and looking in upon the man in the upper tier], you, do you
know that this is a lady you&rsquo;re talking to?</p>
<p>THE UPPER BERTH.&nbsp; By your voice and your shaggy personal appearance
I shouldn&rsquo;t have taken you for a lady&mdash;no, sir.&nbsp; But
the light is very imperfect; you may be a bearded lady.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; You never mind about my looks.&nbsp; The question
is, Do you want your head rapped up against the side of this car?</p>
<p>THE UPPER BERTH.&nbsp; With all the frankness of your own Pacific
slope, no.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (hastily reappearing).&nbsp; Oh, no, no, don&rsquo;t
hurt him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not to blame.&nbsp; I was wrong to keep on
talking.&nbsp; Oh, please don&rsquo;t hurt him!</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (to THE UPPER BERTH).&nbsp; You hear?&nbsp; Well,
now, don&rsquo;t you speak another word to that lady tonight.&nbsp;
Just go on, ma&rsquo;am, and free your mind on any little matter you
like.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want any sleep.&nbsp; How long has your brother
been in California?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about it now;
I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it.&nbsp; I thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;Good-night.&nbsp;
Oh, dear!&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t suppose I was making so much trouble.&nbsp;
I didn&rsquo;t mean to disturb anybody.&nbsp; I&mdash;</p>
<p>[MRS. ROBERTS gives way to the excess of her confusion and mortification
in a little sob, and then hides her grief behind the curtains of her
berth.&nbsp; THE CALIFORNIAN slowly emerges again from his couch, and
stands beside it, looking in upon the man in the berth above.]</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; For half a cent I <i>would</i> rap your head
up against that wall.&nbsp; Making the lady cry, and getting me so mad
I can&rsquo;t sleep!&nbsp; Now see here, you just apologize.&nbsp; You
beg that lady&rsquo;s pardon, or I&rsquo;ll have you out of there before
you know yourself.&nbsp; [Cries of &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
right!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Make him show himself!&rdquo; hail MRS. ROBERTS&rsquo;S
champion, and heads, more or less dishevelled, are thrust from every
berth.&nbsp; MRS. ROBERTS remains invisible and silent, and the loud
and somewhat complicated respiration of her AUNT makes itself heard
in the general hush of expectancy.&nbsp; A remark to the effect that
&ldquo;The old lady seems to enjoy her rest&rdquo; achieves a facile
applause.&nbsp; THE CALIFORNIAN again addresses the culprit.]&nbsp;
Come, now, what do you say?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you just one-half
a minute.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (from her shelter).&nbsp; Oh, please, <i>please</i>
don&rsquo;t make him say anything.&nbsp; It was very trying in me to
keep him awake, and I know he didn&rsquo;t mean any offence.&nbsp; Oh,
<i>do</i> let him be!</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; You hear that?&nbsp; You stay quiet the rest
of the time; and if that lady choses to keep us all awake the whole
night, don&rsquo;t <i>you</i> say a word, or I&rsquo;ll settle with
you in the morning.</p>
<p>[Loud and continued applause, amidst which THE CALIFORNIAN turns
from the man in the berth before him, and restores order by marching
along the aisle of the car in his stocking feet.&nbsp; The heads vanish
behind the curtains.&nbsp; As the laughter subsides, he returns to his
berth, and after a stare up and down the tranquillized car, he is about
to retire.]</p>
<p>A VOICE.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t just bow.&nbsp; Speak!</p>
<p>[A fresh burst of laughter greets this sally.&nbsp; THE CALIFORNIAN
erects himself again with an air of baited wrath, and then suddenly
breaks into a helpless laugh.]</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; Gentlemen, you&rsquo;re too many for <i>me</i>.</p>
<p>[He gets into his berth, and after cries of &ldquo;Good for California!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, William Nye!&rdquo; and &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
several ahead yet!&rdquo; the occupants of the different berths gradually
relapse into silence, and at last, as the car lunges onward through
the darkness, nothing is heard but the rhythmical clank of the machinery,
with now and then a burst of audible slumber from MRS. ROBERTS&rsquo;S
aunt MARY.]</p>
<h2>II.</h2>
<p>At Worcester, where the train has made the usual stop, THE PORTER,
with his lantern on his arm, enters the car, preceding a gentleman somewhat
anxiously smiling; his nervous speech contrasts painfully with the business-like
impassiveness of THE PORTER, who refuses, with an air of incredulity,
to enter into the confidences which the gentleman seems reluctant to
bestow.</p>
<p>MR. EDWARD ROBERTS.&nbsp; This is the Governor Marcy, isn&rsquo;t
it?</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; Yes, sah.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Came on from Albany, and not from New York?</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; Yes, sah, it did.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Ah! it must be all right.&nbsp; I&mdash;</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; Was your wife expecting you to come on board here?</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Well, no, not exactly.&nbsp; She was expecting
me to meet her at Boston.&nbsp; But I&mdash;[struggling to give the
situation dignity, but failing, and throwing himself, with self-convicted
silliness, upon THE PORTER&rsquo;S mercy.]&nbsp; The fact is, I thought
I would surprise her by joining her here.</p>
<p>THE PORTER (refusing to have any mercy).&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; How did
you expect to find her?</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Well&mdash;well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;
I didn&rsquo;t consider.&nbsp; [He looks down the aisle in despair at
the close-drawn curtains of the berths, and up at the dangling hats
and bags and bonnets, and down at the chaos of boots of both sexes on
the floor.]&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know <i>how</i> I expected to find her.</p>
<p>[MR. ROBERTS&rsquo;S countenance falls, and he visibly sinks so low
in his own esteem and an imaginary public opinion that THE PORTER begins
to have a little compassion.]</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; Dey&rsquo;s so many ladies on board <i>I</i> couldn&rsquo;t
find her.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, no, no, of course not.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
expect that.</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t like to go routing &rsquo;em all up,
you know.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t ask it; that would be preposterous.</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; What sort of looking lady was she?</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Well, I don&rsquo;t know, really.&nbsp; Not very
tall, rather slight, blue eyes.&nbsp; I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what
you&rsquo;d call her nose.&nbsp; And&mdash;stop!&nbsp; Oh yes, she had
a child with her, a little boy.&nbsp; Yes!</p>
<p>THE PORTER (thoughtfully looking down the aisle).&nbsp; Dey was three
ladies had children.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t notice whether dey was boys
or girls, or <i>what</i> dey was.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t have anybody with
her?</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; Only the child.</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; Well, I don&rsquo;t know what you are going to
do, sah.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t be a great while now till morning, you
know.&nbsp; Here comes the conductor.&nbsp; Maybe he&rsquo;ll know what
to do.</p>
<p>[MR. ROBERTS makes some futile, inarticulate attempts to prevent
The PORTER from laying the case before THE CONDUCTOR, and then stands
guiltily smiling, overwhelmed with the hopeless absurdity of his position.]</p>
<p>THE CONDUCTOR (entering the car, and stopping before THE PORTER,
and looking at MR. ROBERTS).&nbsp; Gentleman want a berth?</p>
<p>THE PORTER (grinning).&nbsp; Well, no, sah.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s lookin&rsquo;
for his wife.</p>
<p>THE CONDUCTOR (with suspicion).&nbsp; Is she aboard this car?</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS (striving to propitiate THE CONDUCTOR by a dastardly
amiability).&nbsp; Oh, yes, yes.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no mistake about
the car&mdash;the Governor Marcy.&nbsp; She telegraphed the name just
before you left Albany, so that I could find her at Boston in the morning.&nbsp;
Ah!</p>
<p>THE CONDUCTOR.&nbsp; At Boston.&nbsp; [Sternly.]&nbsp; Then what
are you trying to find her at Worcester in the middle of the night for?</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Why&mdash;I&mdash;that is&mdash;</p>
<p>THE PORTER (taking compassion on MR. ROBERTS&rsquo;S inability to
continue).&nbsp; Says he wanted to surprise her.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Ha&mdash;yes, exactly.&nbsp; A little caprice,
you know.</p>
<p>THE CONDUCTOR.&nbsp; Well, that may all be so.&nbsp; [MR. ROBERTS
continues to smile in agonized helplessness against THE CONDUCTOR&rsquo;S
injurious tone, which becomes more and more offensively patronizing.]&nbsp;
But <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t do anything for you.&nbsp; Here are all these
people asleep in their berths, and I can&rsquo;t go round waking them
up because you want to surprise your wife.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; No, no; of course not.&nbsp; I never thought&mdash;</p>
<p>THE CONDUCTOR.&nbsp; My advice to <i>you</i> is to have a berth made
up, and go to bed till we get to Boston, and surprise your wife by telling
her what you tried to do.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS (unable to resent the patronage of this suggestion).&nbsp;
Well, I don&rsquo;t know but I will.</p>
<p>THE CONDUCTOR (going out).&nbsp; The porter will make up the berth
for you.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS (to THE PORTER, who is about to pull down the upper berth
over a vacant seat).&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; Er&mdash;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;ll trouble you to make it up; it&rsquo;s so near morning
now.&nbsp; Just bring me a pillow, and I&rsquo;ll try to get a nap without
lying down.</p>
<p>[He takes the vacant seat.]</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; All right, sah.</p>
<p>[He goes to the end of the car and returns with a pillow.]</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Ah&mdash;porter!</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; Yes, sah.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Of course you didn&rsquo;t notice; but you don&rsquo;t
think you <i>did</i> notice who was in that berth yonder?</p>
<p>[He indicates a certain berth.]</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; Dat&rsquo;s a gen&rsquo;leman in dat berth, I think,
sah.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS (astutely).&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a bonnet hanging from
the hook at the top.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure, but it looks like my
wife&rsquo;s bonnet.</p>
<p>THE PORTER (evidently shaken by this reasoning, but recovering his
firmness).&nbsp; Yes, sah.&nbsp; But you can&rsquo;t depend upon de
ladies to hang deir bonnets on de right hook.&nbsp; Jes&rsquo; likely
as not dat lady&rsquo;s took de hook at de foot of her berth instead
o&rsquo; de head.&nbsp; Sometimes dey takes both.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; [After a pause.]&nbsp; Porter!</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; Yes, sah.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t feel justified in looking?</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t, sah; I couldn&rsquo;t, indeed.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS (reaching his left hand toward THE PORTER&rsquo;S, and
pressing a half dollar into his instantly responsive palm).&nbsp; But
there&rsquo;s nothing to prevent <i>my</i> looking if I feel perfectly
sure of the bonnet?</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; N-no, sah.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; All right.</p>
<p>[THE PORTER retires to the end of the car, and resumes the work of
polishing the passengers&rsquo; boots.&nbsp; After an interval of quiet,
MR. ROBERTS rises, and, looking about him with what he feels to be melodramatic
stealth, approaches the suspected berth.&nbsp; He unloops the curtain
with a trembling hand, and peers ineffectually in; he advances his head
further and further into the darkened recess, and then suddenly dodges
back again, with THE CALIFORNIAN hanging to his neckcloth with one hand.]</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (savagely).&nbsp; What do you want?</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS (struggling and breathless).&nbsp; I&mdash;I&mdash;I
want my wife.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; Want your wife!&nbsp; Have <i>I</i> got your
wife?</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; No&mdash;ah&mdash;that is&mdash;ah, excuse me&mdash;I
thought you <i>were</i> my wife.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (getting out of the berth, but at the same time keeping
hold of MR. ROBERTS).&nbsp; Thought I was your <i>wife</i>!&nbsp; Do
I look like your wife?&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t play that on me, old man.&nbsp;
Porter! conductor!</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS (agonized).&nbsp; Oh, I beseech you, my dear sir, don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t!&nbsp;
I can explain it&mdash;I can indeed.&nbsp; I know it has an ugly look;
but if you will allow me two words&mdash;only two words&mdash;</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (suddenly parting the curtain of her berth, and springing
out into the aisle, with her hair wildly dishevelled).&nbsp; Edward!</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, Agnes, explain to this gentleman!&nbsp; [Imploringly.]&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you know me?</p>
<p>A VOICE.&nbsp; Make him show you the strawberry mark on his left
arm.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Edward!&nbsp; Edward!&nbsp; [THE CALIFORNIAN
mechanically looses his grip, and they fly into each other&rsquo;s embrace.]&nbsp;
Where did you come from?</p>
<p>A VOICE.&nbsp; Centre door, left hand, one back.</p>
<p>THE CONDUCTOR (returning with his lantern).&nbsp; Hallo!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
the matter here?</p>
<p>A VOICE.&nbsp; Train robbers!&nbsp; Throw up your hands!&nbsp; Tell
the express-messenger to bring his safe.</p>
<p>[The passengers emerge from their berths in various deshabille and
bewilderment.]</p>
<p>THE CONDUCTOR (to MR. ROBERTS).&nbsp; Have you been making all this
row, waking up my passengers?</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; No, sir, he hasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
been making this row.&nbsp; This gentleman was peaceably looking for
his wife, and I misunderstood him.&nbsp; You want to say anything to
me?</p>
<p>THE CONDUCTOR (silently taking THE CALIFORNIAN&rsquo;S measure with
his eye, as he stands six fret in his stockings).&nbsp; If I did, I&rsquo;d
get the biggest brakeman I could find to do it for me.&nbsp; <i>I&rsquo;ve</i>
got nothing to say except that I think you&rsquo;d better all go back
to bed again.</p>
<p>[He goes out, and the passengers disappear one by one, leaving the
ROBERTSES and THE CALIFORNIAN alone.]</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (to MR. ROBERTS).&nbsp; Stranger, I&rsquo;m sorry
I got you into this scrape.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t speak of it, my dear sir.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure we owe you all sorts of apologies, which I shall be most
happy to offer you at my house in Boston, with every needful explanation.&nbsp;
[He takes out his card, and gives it to THE CALIFORNIAN, who looks at
it, and then looks at MR. ROBERTS curiously.]&nbsp; There&rsquo;s my
address, and I&rsquo;m sure we shall both be glad to have you call.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, yes indeed.&nbsp; [THE CALIFORNIAN parts
the curtains of his berth to re-enter it.]&nbsp; Good-night, sir, and
I assure you <i>we</i> shall do nothing more to disturb you&mdash;shall
we, Edward?</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; And now, dear, I think you&rsquo;d better
go back to your berth.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t sleep, and I shall not go back.&nbsp;
Is this your place?&nbsp; I will just rest my head on your shoulder;
and we must both be perfectly quiet.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve no idea what
a nuisance I have been making of myself.&nbsp; The whole car was perfectly
furious at me one time, I kept talking so loud.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know how I came to do it, but I suppose it was thinking about you and
Willis meeting without knowing each other made me nervous, and I couldn&rsquo;t
be still.&nbsp; I woke everybody up with my talking, and some of them
were quite outrageous in their remarks; but I didn&rsquo;t blame them
the least bit, for I should have been just as bad.&nbsp; That California
gentleman was perfectly splendid, though.&nbsp; I can tell you <i>he</i>
made them stop.&nbsp; We struck up quite a friendship.&nbsp; I told
him I had a brother coming on from California, and he&rsquo;s going
to try to think whether he knows Willis.&nbsp; [Groans and inarticulate
protests make themselves heard from different berths.]&nbsp; I declare,
I&rsquo;ve got to talking again!&nbsp; There, now, I <i>shall</i> stop,
and they won&rsquo;t hear another squeak from me the rest of the night.&nbsp;
[She lifts her head from her husband&rsquo;s shoulder.]&nbsp;&nbsp;
I wonder if baby will roll out.&nbsp; He <i>does</i> kick so!&nbsp;
And I just sprang up and left him when I heard your voice, without putting
anything to keep him in.&nbsp; I <i>must</i> go and have a look at him,
or I never can settle down.&nbsp; No, no, don&rsquo;t you go, Edward;
you&rsquo;ll be prying into all the wrong berths in the car, you poor
thing!&nbsp; You stay here, and I&rsquo;ll be back in half a second.&nbsp;
I wonder which is my berth.&nbsp; Ah! that&rsquo;s it; I know the one
now.&nbsp; [She makes a sudden dash at a berth, and pulling open the
curtains is confronted by the bearded visage of THE CALIFORNIAN.]&nbsp;
Ah!&nbsp; Ow! ow!&nbsp; Edward!&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; I&mdash;I beg your pardon,
sir; excuse me; I didn&rsquo;t know it was you.&nbsp; I came for my
baby.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (solemnly).&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t got any baby, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; No&mdash;no&mdash;I thought you were my baby.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; Perhaps I am, ma&rsquo;am; I&rsquo;ve lost
so much sleep I could cry, anyway.&nbsp; Do I <i>look</i> like your
baby?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; No, no, you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; [In distress that
overcomes her mortification.]&nbsp; Oh, where is my baby?&nbsp; I left
him all uncovered, and he&rsquo;ll take his death of cold, even if he
doesn&rsquo;t roll out.&nbsp; Oh, Edward, Edward, help me to find baby!</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS (bustling aimlessly about).&nbsp; Yes, yes; certainly,
my dear.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t be alarmed; we shall find him.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (getting out in his stocking feet).&nbsp; We shall
find him, ma&rsquo;am, if we have to search every berth in this car.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you take on.&nbsp; That baby&rsquo;s going to be found if
he&rsquo;s aboard the train, now, you bet!&nbsp; [He looks about and
then tears open the curtains of a berth at random.]&nbsp; That your
baby, ma&rsquo;am?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (flying upon the infant thus exposed).&nbsp; Oh, <i>baby</i>,
baby, baby!!&nbsp; I thought I had lost you.&nbsp; Um! um! um!</p>
<p>[She clasps him in her arms, and covers his face and neck with kisses.]</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (as he gets back into his berth, sotto voce).&nbsp;
I wish I <i>had</i> been her baby.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (returning with her husband to his seat, and bringing
the baby with her).&nbsp; There!&nbsp; Did you ever see such a sleeper,
Edward?&nbsp; [In her ecstasy she abandons all control of her voice,
and joyfully exclaims.]&nbsp; He has slept all through this excitement,
without a wink.</p>
<p>A solemn Voice from one of the berths.&nbsp; I envy him.</p>
<p>[A laugh follows, in which all the passengers join.]</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (in a hoarse whisper, breaking a little with laughter).&nbsp;
Oh, my goodness! there I went again.&nbsp; But how funny!&nbsp; I assure
you, Edward, that if their remarks had not been about me, I could have
really quite enjoyed some of them.&nbsp; I wish there had been somebody
here to take them down.&nbsp; And I hope I shall see some of the speakers
in the morning before&mdash;Edward, I&rsquo;ve got an idea!</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS (endeavoring to teach his wife by example to lower her
voice, which has risen again).&nbsp; What&mdash;what is it, my dear?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Why, don&rsquo;t you see?&nbsp; How perfectly
ridiculous it was of me not to think of it before! though I did think
of it once, and hadn&rsquo;t the courage to insist upon it.&nbsp; But
of course it is; and it accounts for his being so polite and kind to
me through all, and it&rsquo;s the only thing that can.&nbsp; Yes, yes,
it must be.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS (mystified).&nbsp; What?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Willis.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Who?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; This Californian.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh!</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; No <i>stranger</i> could have been so patient
and&mdash;and&mdash;attentive; and I know that he recognized me from
the first, and he&rsquo;s just kept it up for a joke, so as to surprise
us and have a good laugh at us when we get to Boston.&nbsp; Of <i>course</i>
it&rsquo;s Willis.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS (doubtfully).&nbsp; Do you think so, my dear?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; I <i>know</i> it.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you notice
how he looked at your card?&nbsp; And I want you to go at once and speak
to him, and turn the tables on him.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; I&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather <i>not</i>, my dear.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Why, Edward, what can you mean?</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s very violent.&nbsp; Suppose it <i>shouldn&rsquo;t</i>
be Willis?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Nonsense!&nbsp; It <i>is</i> Willis.&nbsp; Come,
let&rsquo;s both go and just tax him with it.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t deny
it, after all he&rsquo;s done for me.&nbsp; [She pulls her reluctant
husband toward THE CALIFORNIAN&rsquo;S berth, and they each draw a curtain.]&nbsp;
Willis!</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (with plaintive endurance).&nbsp; Well, ma&rsquo;am?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (triumphantly).&nbsp; There!&nbsp; I knew it was you
all along.&nbsp; How could you play such a joke on me?</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;d been any
joke; but I suppose there must have been, if you say so.&nbsp; Who am
I now, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;your husband, or your baby, or your husband&rsquo;s
wife, or&mdash;</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; How funny you are!&nbsp; You <i>know</i> you&rsquo;re
Willis Campbell, my only brother.&nbsp; Now <i>don&rsquo;t</i> try to
keep it up any longer, Willis.</p>
<p>[Voices from various berths.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give us a rest, Willis!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Joke&rsquo;s too thin, Willis!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
played out, Willis!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Own up, old fellow&mdash;own
up!&rdquo;]</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (issuing from his berth, and walking up and down
the aisle, as before, till quiet is restored).&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t
got any sister, and my name ain&rsquo;t Willis, and it ain&rsquo;t Campbell.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m very sorry, because I&rsquo;d like to oblige you any way I
could.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (in deep mortification).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s I who ought
to apologize, and I do most humbly.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what to
say; but when I got to thinking about it, and how kind you had been
to me, and how sweet you had been under all my&mdash;interruptions,
I felt perfectly sure that you couldn&rsquo;t be a mere stranger, and
then the idea struck me that you must be my brother in disguise; and
I was so certain of it that I couldn&rsquo;t help just letting you know
that we&rsquo;d found you out, and&mdash;</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS (offering a belated and feeble moral support).&nbsp;
Yes.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (promptly turning upon him).&nbsp; And <i>you</i> ought
to have kept me from making such a simpleton of myself, Edward.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (soothingly).&nbsp; Well, ma&rsquo;am, that ain&rsquo;t
always so easy.&nbsp; A man may mean well, and yet not be able to carry
out his intentions.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; And I reckon
we&rsquo;d better try to quiet down again, and get what rest we can.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Why, yes, certainly; and I will try&mdash;oh,
I will <i>try</i> not to disturb you again.&nbsp; And if there&rsquo;s
anything we can do in reparation after we reach Boston, we shall be
so glad to do it!</p>
<p>[They bow themselves away, and return to their seat, while THE CALIFORNIAN
re-enters his berth.]</p>
<h2>III.</h2>
<p>The train stops at Framingham, and THE PORTER comes in with a passenger
whom he shows to the seat opposite MR. and MRS. ROBERTS.</p>
<p>THE PORTER.&nbsp; You can sit here, sah.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be in
in about an hour now.&nbsp; Hang up your bag for you, sah?</p>
<p>THE PASSENGER.&nbsp; No, leave it on the seat here.</p>
<p>[THE PORTER goes out, and the ROBERTSES maintain a dejected silence.&nbsp;
The bottom of the bag, thrown carelessly on the seat, is toward the
ROBERTSES, who regard it listlessly.]</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (suddenly clutching her husband&rsquo;s arm, and hissing
in his ear).&nbsp; See!&nbsp; [She points to the white lettering on
the bag, where the name &ldquo;Willis Campbell, San Francisco,&rdquo;
is distinctly legible.]&nbsp; But it can&rsquo;t be; it must be some
other Campbell.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t risk it.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s the name.&nbsp; It would be
very strange if there were two people from San Francisco of exactly
the same name.&nbsp; <i>I</i> will speak.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (as wildly as one can in whisper).&nbsp; No, no, I can&rsquo;t
let you.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve made ourselves the laughing-stock of the
whole car already with our mistakes, and I can&rsquo;t go on.&nbsp;
I would rather perish than ask him.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t suppose it
<i>could</i> be?&nbsp; No, it couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There may be twenty
Willis Campbells in San Francisco, and there probably are.&nbsp; Do
you think he looks like me!&nbsp; He has a straight nose; but you can&rsquo;t
tell anything about the lower part of his face, the beard covers it
so; and I can&rsquo;t make out the color of his eyes by this light.&nbsp;
But of course it&rsquo;s all nonsense.&nbsp; Still if it <i>should</i>
be!&nbsp; It would be very stupid of us to ride all the way from Framingham
to Boston with that name staring one in the eyes.&nbsp; I wish he would
turn it away.&nbsp; If it really turned out to <i>be</i> Willis, he
would think we were awfully stiff and cold.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t
help it; I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> go attacking every stranger I see, and
accusing him of being my brother.&nbsp; No, no, I can&rsquo;t, and I
<i>won&rsquo;t</i>, and that&rsquo;s all about it.&nbsp; [She leans
forward and addresses the stranger with sudden sweetness.]&nbsp; Excuse
me, sir, but I <i>am</i> very much interested by the name on your bag.&nbsp;
Not that I think you are even acquainted with him, and there are probably
a great many of them there; but your coming from the same city and all
<i>does</i> seem a little queer, and I hope you won&rsquo;t think me
intrusive in speaking to you, because if you <i>should</i> happen, by
the thousandth of a chance, to be the right one, I should be <i>so</i>
happy!</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; The right what, madam?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; The right Willis Campbell.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; I hope I&rsquo;m not the wrong one; though after
a week&rsquo;s pull on the railroad it&rsquo;s pretty hard for a man
to tell which Willis Campbell he is.&nbsp; May I ask if your Willis
Campbell had friends in Boston?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (eagerly).&nbsp; He had a sister and a brother-in-law
and a nephew.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; Name of Roberts?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Every one.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;re&mdash;</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (ecstatically).&nbsp; Agnes!</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; And he&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Mr. Roberts!</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; And the baby&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Asleep!</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; Then <i>I</i> am the right one.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, Willis!&nbsp; Willis!&nbsp; Willis!&nbsp;
To think of our meeting in this way!&nbsp; [She kisses and embraces
him, while MR. ROBERTS shakes one of his hands which he finds disengaged.]&nbsp;
<i>How</i> in the world did it happen?</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; Ah, I found myself a little ahead of time, and I
stopped off with an old friend of mine at Framingham; I didn&rsquo;t
want to disappoint you when you came to meet this train, or get you
up last night at midnight.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; And I was in Albany, and I&rsquo;ve been moving
heaven and earth to get home before you arrived; and Edward came aboard
at Worcester to surprise me, and&mdash;Oh, you&rsquo;ve never seen the
baby!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll run right and get him this instant, just as he
is, and bring him.&nbsp; Edward, you be explaining to Willis&mdash;Oh,
my goodness!&nbsp; [Looking wildly about.]&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t remember
the berth, and I shall be sure to wake up that poor California gentleman
again.&nbsp; <i>What</i> shall I do?</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; What California gentleman?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, somebody we&rsquo;ve been stirring up the
whole blessed night.&nbsp; First I took him for baby, and then Edward
took him for me, and then I took him for baby again, and then we both
took him for you.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; Did he look like any of us?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Like <i>us</i>?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s eight feet tall,
if he&rsquo;s an inch, in his stockings&mdash;and he&rsquo;s always
in them&mdash;and he has a long black beard and mustaches, and he&rsquo;s
very lanky, and stoops over a good deal; but he&rsquo;s just as lovely
as he can be and live, and he&rsquo;s been as kind and patient as twenty
Jobs.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; Speaks in a sort of soft, slow grind?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; Gentle and deferential to ladies?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; As pie.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Tom Goodall.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have him
out of there in half a second.&nbsp; I want you to take him home with
you, Agnes.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the best fellow in the world.&nbsp; <i>Which</i>
is his berth?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t ask me, Willis.&nbsp; But if you&rsquo;d
go for baby, you&rsquo;ll be sure to find him.</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS (timidly indicating a berth).&nbsp; I think that&rsquo;s
the one.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL (plunging at it, and pulling the curtains open).&nbsp; You
old Tom Goodall!</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (appearing).&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t any Tom Goodall.&nbsp;
My name&rsquo;s Abram Sawyer.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL (falling back).&nbsp; Well, sir, you&rsquo;re right.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m awfully sorry to disturb you; but, from my sister&rsquo;s
description here, I felt certain you must be my old friend Tom Goodall.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t surprised at it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
only surprised I <i>ain&rsquo;t</i> Tom Goodall.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
a baby twice, and I&rsquo;ve been a man&rsquo;s wife once, and once
I&rsquo;ve been a long-lost brother.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL (laughing).&nbsp; Oh, they&rsquo;ve found <i>him</i>.&nbsp;
<i>I&rsquo;m</i> the long-lost brother.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (sleepily).&nbsp; Has she found the other one?</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; Yes; all right, I believe.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; Has <i>he</i> found what <i>he</i> wanted?</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; Yes; we&rsquo;re all together here.&nbsp; [THE CALIFORNIAN
makes a movement to get into bed again.]&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t!&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d better make a night of it now.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s almost morning
anyway.&nbsp; We want you to go home with us, and Mrs. Roberts will
give you a bed at her house, and let you sleep a week.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; Well, I reckon you&rsquo;re right, stranger.&nbsp;
I seem to be in the hands of Providence tonight anyhow.&nbsp; [He pulls
on his boots and coat, and takes his seat beside CAMPBELL.]&nbsp; I
reckon there ain&rsquo;t any use in fighting against Providence.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (briskly, as if she had often tried it and failed).&nbsp;
Oh, not the least in the world.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure it was all intended;
and if you had turned out to be Willis at last, I should be <i>certain</i>
of it.&nbsp; What surprises me is that you shouldn&rsquo;t turn out
to be anybody, after all.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; Yes, it is kind of curious.&nbsp; But I couldn&rsquo;t
help it.&nbsp; I did my best.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t speak of it.&nbsp; <i>We</i>
are the ones who ought to apologize.&nbsp; But if you only had been
somebody, it would have been such a good joke!&nbsp; We could always
have had such a laugh over it, don&rsquo;t you see?</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; Yes, ma&rsquo;am, it would have been funny.&nbsp;
But I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed it as it is.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, very much, thanks to you.&nbsp; Only I can&rsquo;t
seem to get reconciled to your not being anybody, after all.&nbsp; You
<i>must</i> at least be some one we&rsquo;ve heard about, don&rsquo;t
you think?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so strange that you and Willis never even
met.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think you have some acquaintances in common?</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; Look here, Agnes, do you always shout at the top
of your voice in this way when you converse in a sleeping-car?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Was I talking loud again?&nbsp; Well, you can&rsquo;t
help it if you want to make people hear you.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; But there must be a lot of them who don&rsquo;t want
to hear you.&nbsp; I wonder that the passengers who are not blood-relations
don&rsquo;t throw things at you&mdash;boots and hand-bags and language.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Why, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve <i>been</i>
doing&mdash;language, at least&mdash;and I&rsquo;m only surprised they&rsquo;re
not doing it now.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (rising).&nbsp; They&rsquo;d better not, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p>[He patrols the car from end to end, and quells some rising murmurs,
halting at the rebellious berths as he passes.]</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (enraptured by his companionship).&nbsp; Oh, he <i>must</i>
be some connection.&nbsp; [She glances through the window.]&nbsp; I
do believe that was Newton, or Newtonville, or West Newton, or Newton
Centre.&nbsp; I must run and wake up baby, and get him dressed.&nbsp;
I shan&rsquo;t want to wait an instant after we get in.&nbsp; Why, we&rsquo;re
slowing up!&nbsp; Why, I do believe we&rsquo;re there!&nbsp; Edward,
we&rsquo;re there!&nbsp; Only fancy being there already!</p>
<p>MR. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Yes, my dear.&nbsp; Only we&rsquo;re not quite
there yet.&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t we better call your aunt Mary?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d forgotten her.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; Is Aunt Mary with you?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; To be sure she is.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I tell
you?&nbsp; She came on expressly to meet you.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL (starting up impetuously).&nbsp; Which berth is she in?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Right over baby.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; And which berth is baby in?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (distractedly).&nbsp; Why, that&rsquo;s just what I
can&rsquo;t <i>tell</i>.&nbsp; It was bad enough when they were all
filled up, but now since the people have begun to come out of them,
and some of them are made into seats I can&rsquo;t tell.</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll look for you, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp;
I should like to wake up all the wrong passengers on this car.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d take a pleasure in it.&nbsp; If you could make sure of any
berth that <i>ain&rsquo;t</i> the one, I&rsquo;ll begin on that.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t even be sure of the wrong one.&nbsp;
No, no; you mustn&rsquo;t&mdash;[THE CALIFORNIAN moves away, and pauses
in front of one of the berths, looking back inquiringly at MRS. ROBERTS.]&nbsp;
Oh, don&rsquo;t ask <i>me</i>!&nbsp; <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp;
[To CAMPBELL.]&nbsp; <i>Isn&rsquo;t</i> he amusing?&nbsp; So like all
those Californians that one reads of&mdash;so chivalrous and <i>so</i>
humorous!</p>
<p>AUNT MARY (thrusting her head from the curtains of the berth before
which THE CALIFORNIAN is standing).&nbsp; Go along with you!&nbsp; What
do you want?</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; Aunt Mary.</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Go away.&nbsp; Aunt Mary, indeed!</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (running toward her, followed by CAMPBELL and MR. ROBERTS).&nbsp;
Why, Aunt Mary, it <i>is</i> you!&nbsp; And here&rsquo;s Willis, and
here&rsquo;s Edward.</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Nonsense!&nbsp; How did they get aboard?</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Edward came on at Worcester and Willis at Framingham,
to surprise me.</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; And a very silly performance.&nbsp; Let them wait
till I&rsquo;m dressed, and then I&rsquo;ll talk to them.&nbsp; Send
for the porter.&nbsp; [She withdraws her head behind the curtain, and
then thrusts it out again.]&nbsp; And who, pray, may <i>this</i> be?</p>
<p>[She indicates THE CALIFORNIAN.]</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh, a friend of ours from California, who&rsquo;s
been so kind to us all night, and who&rsquo;s going home with us.</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Another ridiculous surprise, I suppose.&nbsp; But
he shall not surprise <i>me</i>.&nbsp; Young man, isn&rsquo;t your name
Sawyer?</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; Yes, ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Abram?</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; Abram Sawyer.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re right there,
ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS.&nbsp; Oh! oh!&nbsp; I knew it!&nbsp; I knew that he
must be somebody belonging to us.&nbsp; Oh, thank you, aunty, for thinking&mdash;</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be absurd, Agnes.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;re
my&mdash;</p>
<p>A VOICE from one of the berths.&nbsp; Lost step-son.&nbsp; Found!
found at last!</p>
<p>[THE CALIFORNIAN looks vainly round in an endeavor to identify the
speaker, and then turns again to AUNT MARY.]</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Weren&rsquo;t your parents from Bath?</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN (eagerly).&nbsp; Both of &rsquo;em, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;both
of &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>THE VOICE.&nbsp; O my prophetic soul, my uncle!</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;re my old friend Kate Harris&rsquo;s
daughter?</p>
<p>THE CALIFORNIAN.&nbsp; I might be her <i>son</i>, ma&rsquo;am; but
<i>my</i> mother&rsquo;s name was Susan Wakeman.</p>
<p>AUNT MARY (in sharp disgust).&nbsp; Call the porter, please.</p>
<p>[She withdraws her head and pulls her curtains together; the rest
look blankly at one another.]</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; Another failure, and just when we thought we were
sure of you.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what we shall do about you, Mr.
Sawyer.</p>
<p>THE VOICE.&nbsp; Adopt him.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a good idea.&nbsp; We will adopt you.&nbsp;
You shall be our adoptive&mdash;</p>
<p>THE VOICE.&nbsp; Baby boy.</p>
<p>ANOTHER VOICE.&nbsp; Wife.</p>
<p>A THIRD VOICE.&nbsp; Brother.</p>
<p>A FOURTH VOICE.&nbsp; Early friend.</p>
<p>A FIFTH VOICE.&nbsp; Kate Harris&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL (laying his hand on THE CALIFORNIAN&rsquo;S shoulder, and
breaking into a laugh).&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind them.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t
mean anything.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just their way.&nbsp; You come home
with my sister, and spend Christmas, and let us devote the rest of our
lives to making your declining years happy.</p>
<p>VOICES.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good for you, Willis!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
all come!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No ceremony!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Small
and early!&rdquo;</p>
<p>CAMPBELL (looking round).&nbsp; We appear to have fallen in with
a party of dry-goods drummers.&nbsp; It makes a gentleman feel like
an intruder.&nbsp; [The train stops; he looks out of the window.]&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve arrived.&nbsp; Come, Agnes; come, Roberts; come, Mr. Sawyer&mdash;let&rsquo;s
be going.</p>
<p>[They gather up their several wraps and bags, and move with great
dignity toward the door.]</p>
<p>AUNT MARY (putting out her head).&nbsp; Agnes!&nbsp; If you must
forget your aunt, at least remember your child.</p>
<p>MRS. ROBERTS (running back in an agony of remorse).&nbsp; Oh, <i>baby</i>,
did I forget you?</p>
<p>CAMPBELL.&nbsp; Oh, <i>aunty</i>, did she forget you?&nbsp; [He runs
back, and extends his arms to his aunt.]&nbsp; Let me help you down,
Aunt Mary.</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; Nonsense, Willis.&nbsp; Send the porter.</p>
<p>CAMPBELL (turning round and confronting THE PORTER).&nbsp; He was
here upon instinct.&nbsp; Shall he fetch a step-ladder?</p>
<p>AUNT MARY.&nbsp; <i>He</i> will know what to do.&nbsp; Go away, Willis;
go away with that child, Agnes.&nbsp; If I should happen to fall on
you&mdash;[They retreat; the curtain drops, and her voice is heard behind
it addressing THE PORTER.]&nbsp; Give me your hand; now your back; now
your knee.&nbsp; So!&nbsp; And very well done.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
